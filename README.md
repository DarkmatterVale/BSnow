BSnow - winter weather for BeOS

Copyright 2003 Francois Revol.

Features:

- adapts the number of snow flakes to the CPU frequency to avoid hogging it,
- random wind change,
- the fallen snow accumulates on the windows and bottom of the screen,


Limitations:
- lot of flicker,
- it needs to set the desktop view flags to B_DRAW_ON_CHILDREN, which might gives weird drawing with some replicants afterwards,
